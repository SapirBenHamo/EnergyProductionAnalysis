Renewable or Reliant? Analyzing the Global Shift Towards Sustainable Energy Sources in Electricity Generation

This project is a comprehensive study of the trends in electricity generation globally. The analysis focuses on identifying the extent of renewable energies as a source of electricity, being used by different continents and countries. The project involved analyzing data related to electricity generation and a variety of energy sources production.

Code:

[energy_production_sql_notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/SapirBenHamo/EnergyProduction/blob/main/energy_production_sql_notebook.ipynb): This notebook includes the SQL queries, which are built from three main parts of the analysis: the global analysis of electricity generation trends,  the analysis of electricity generation trends among different continents, and the drill-down analysis of six countries with different economic, social, and environmental characteristics with micro view analysis of Israel's energy production.

[energy_production_python.ipynb](https://github.com/SapirBenHamo/EnergyProduction/blob/main/energy_production_python.ipynb): This notebook includes graph which describe the correlation between GDP per capita and the use of renewable energies for electricity generation, in continent level.
Energy_Production.sql: This file includes the SQL queries.

Data:

EnergyProdDB.csv: This file includes the database that has been used for this analysis. It includes information regarding the total energy amount each country generated in each year between the years 1900 - 2018, and for each source of energy. Additionally, this DB contains the GDP level for each country in the years mentioned.
